# Code Refactored HTML and CSS

## Description

This is a website produced from a starter code that had several issues within that needed to be solved. The main objective was to make the website semantical, accessible, and functional while producing the same design website as before. This was done by editing the HTML/CSS, replacing nonsemantic language with semantical, fixing small bugs, and reorganizing the code.

## Tasks completed

- New title added to better represent webpage
- Redundant code consolidated
- Semantic HTML added to code to make more accessible
- Comments added to explain changes made to code
- Descriptions added to alt atrributes to label images
- CSS was consolidated to organize code for better accessibility
