# Code Refactored HTML and CSS

## Description

This is a website produced from a starter code that had several issues within that needed to be solved. The main objective was to make the website semantical, accessible, and functional while producing the same design website as before. This was done by editing the HTML/CSS, replacing nonsemantic language with semantical, fixing small bugs, and reorganizing the code.

##Tasks completed

- Redundant classes were consolidated
- HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
- Alt text was added to images
- Explanatory comments were provided in the HTML document
- CSS was reorganized to follow a logical structure
-  Classes and elements were separated, then ordered alphabetically within each group
-  Comments added to delineate each separation
- A descriptive title was added

## Installation

Upload index.html, license.txt, and assets folder to the deployed webserver. The assets folder contains images and CSS files.

The deployed website linked above was deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Usage

This application demonstrates how code can be improved for better accessibility through the changing of nonsemantic language to semantic language. Both the HTML skeleton and linked style.css can be reorganized for better usability and search engine optimization. All changes made from original starter code is identified through comments incorporated into the code. Users of this application will be able to tell which decisions were made and why.
